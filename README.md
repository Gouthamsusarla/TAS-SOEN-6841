# Do Less, Lead More

## Motivation

In today's dynamic and fast-paced work environments, the role of an engineering manager is multifaceted and demanding. The traditional approach of attempting to do everything often leads to burnout, decreased efficiency, and hindered team growth. Recognizing the need for a paradigm shift, the motivation behind "Do Less, Lead More" is to empower engineering managers to strategically navigate their responsibilities. By focusing on leadership, delegation, and intentional decision-making, managers can not only enhance their own well-being but also foster a culture of growth within their teams.

## Problem Statement

The challenge faced by engineering managers is the overwhelming pressure to handle an extensive array of tasks, from technical responsibilities to team management and strategic planning. This leads to a common pitfall where managers attempt to juggle everything, resulting in compromised performance, increased stress levels, and potential negative impacts on the team. The problem is exacerbated when managers fail to recognize the necessity of intentional decision-making and prioritization, often leading to burnout and decreased overall effectiveness.
