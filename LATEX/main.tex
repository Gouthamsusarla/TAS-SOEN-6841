The topic "Do Less, Lead More" explores the pivotal transition faced by engineering managers as they ascend in their roles, often grappling with the challenge of balancing an expanding array of responsibilities. From the initial shift to management, managing multiple teams, to handling growth spurts in a startup, leaders frequently encounter a tipping point where the conventional approach of attempting to do everything becomes counterproductive. The narrative delves into the common pitfalls of overcommitment and the adverse effects on decision-making, sleep patterns, and overall team dynamics.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

Highlighting the manager's dilemma, the discourse emphasizes a crucial managerial superpower â€” the intentional decision to not do certain tasks. The narrative unfolds with strategic decision-making processes, guiding managers on adapting to new leadership roles and strategically choosing priorities through the "bad news test." It stresses the significance of task delegation, particularly when leading multiple teams.

\vspace{\baselineskip}

The concept of transparent leadership takes centre stage, advocating for open communication about priorities, responsibilities, and strategic shifts. The discussion extends to the necessity of building trust through transparent communication and empowering team members through intentional delegation. The narrative explores the dual benefits of delivering what truly matters and simultaneously levelling up the team by strategically choosing what not to do.
